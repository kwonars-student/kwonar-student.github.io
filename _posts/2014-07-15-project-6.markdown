description: I have experience producing interactive artwork for an exhibition collaborating with the artist Pak Lam Sin. This project includes engineering tasks enabling guests to interact with the screen by walking. During the project, I constructed a system that recognizes people through the camera and expresses them in the artwork. Our work was successfully exhibited at KOTE, an exhibition complex in Seoul in August 2022.<br><br><br><span style="font-family:Droid serif; padding:0px 0px 4px 0px; display:inline-block"><i><b>Project details:</b></i></span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Integrated camera and YOLO model in Python process using OpenCV.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Built TouchDesigner's socket programming environment for Inter-Process Communication (IPC).</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Defined variable types and formats for data transfer.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Synchronized Python process with TouchDesigner.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Configured logic to extract up to three people excluding other objects.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Implemented logic to extract the coordinate of each person.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Confirmed expression accuracy and time of the artwork.</span><br><span style="padding:4px; display:inline-block">· Tuned the whole system through rehearsal.</span>
