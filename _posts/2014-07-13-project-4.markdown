description: When I worked at Continental, my role was to develop the vehicle's Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with professional UI designers. This work includes resource optimization, display priorities setting, vehicle and option-specific graphics implementation, country-specific interfaces implementation, driver's menu configurations, animation tasks, applying sound effects, etc. During this period, I learned that detail of visual elements such as letter spacing and line spacing of fonts and subtle differences in color expression could make a huge difference in user experience. Also, through internal seminars, I learned about current driver HMI trends, such as wide displays, tactile displays, and interactive HMIs. Currently, the project I participated in was applied to the <i>HYUNDAI SONATA N</i> model and contributed to the satisfaction of customers worldwide.
