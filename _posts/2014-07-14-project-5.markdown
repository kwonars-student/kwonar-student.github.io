description: I participated in a study group on interaction design where people from various disciplines gathered, such as visual design, industrial design, and communication design. The purpose of this group was to learn about an unfamiliar field from each other with interdisciplinary perspectives. During the study, we reviewed various HCI-related papers and user experience (UX) books on various topics. Specifically, our group covered human-animal interaction, human-artificial intelligence (AI) interaction, webtoons with virtual reality (VR), marketing with metaverse, interfaces by cultural characteristics, etc. Also, we covered broad qualitative research methodologies such as Q methodology and grounded theory in addition to quantitative methods. Consequently, our group gained a comprehensive understanding of research by dealing with diverse research approaches.
