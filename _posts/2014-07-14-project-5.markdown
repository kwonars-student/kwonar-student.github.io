description: I participated in a study group on interaction design where people from various disciplines gathered, such as visual design, industrial design, and communication design. The purpose of this group was to learn about an unfamiliar field from each other with interdisciplinary perspectives. Our group covered a wide range of topics related to user experience (UX) and interaction design, such as human-animal interaction, human-artificial intelligence (AI) interaction, webtoons with virtual reality (VR), marketing with metaverse, and interfaces by cultural characteristics. For this study, we reviewed related HCI papers and UX books and learned qualitative research methodologies such as Q methodology and grounded theory. By learning different research approaches, we have learned to understand research comprehensively.
