description: My colleagues and I designed a contact-free church service in the UX Practice course. Recently, online activities are on the rise owing to modern technologies. In particular, those online activities were much essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we tried to explore contact-free online interaction methods and discover possibilities of communication in non-face-to-face situations. Specifically, we conducted the user diary study and Focus Group Interview (FGI) of the believers and found their pain points and needs from their emotional adjectives. Based on this analysis, we formed an affinity diagram and developed the overall UX concept. Accordingly, we created the user journey map and performed wireframe works for mobile and laptop.<br><br><br><span style="font-family:Droid serif; padding:0px 0px 4px 0px; display:inline-block"><i><b>Project details:</b></i></span><br>The key features of our service are as follows:<br></p><p style="text-align:left; font-family:Droid serif; font-style:Italic; margin-bottom:10.5px;"><b>1. Interactive Sermon</b></p><p style="text-align:left;">Interactive Sermon provides an extended worship experience by sending the letter of thankful memories of the previous week to the pastor and listening to related sermons.</p><p style="text-align:left; font-family:Droid serif; font-style:Italic; margin-bottom:10.5px;"><b>2. Pre-appearance Check</b></p><p style="text-align:left;">Pre-appearance Check maintains the faithful experiences in contact-free worship situations. This feature helps believers to self-check their appearance before entering worship in a solemn atmosphere.</p><p style="text-align:left; font-family:Droid serif; font-style:Italic; margin-bottom:10.5px;"><b>3. Thank Offering</b></p><p style="text-align:left;">Thank Offering enables believers to be immersed in worship by expressing the unit of currency in ancient terminology and reminded of thankful memories by writing a thank letter while sending offerings.</p><p style="text-align:left; font-family:Droid serif; font-style:Italic; margin-bottom:10.5px;"><b>4. Bible Verse Recommendation</b></p><p style="text-align:left;">Bible Verse Recommendation activates online church activities through tailored verses by usersâ€™ emotional keywords and brings believers closer to the Bible by sharing undiscovered valuable verses.
